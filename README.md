## Summary

Iâ€™ve created a small project related to kids' books, inspired by my little one.ðŸ™‚
It includes a home page, a kids' books page with filters, an add-to-cart function, a remove-from-cart feature (using the minus sign on each item or int the cart), a cart page, and a payment section with messages.
